# APT-GET (Argument Summary)

---

## update

* Update is used to resynchronize the package index file from their sources The indexes of available packages are fetched from the locations specified in /etc/apt/sources.list. Update should do before “upgrade” or “dist-upgrade” so that apt-get knows that new versions of packages are available 


## upgrade

* Upgrade is used to install newest versions of all packages currently installed on the system from sources enumerated in /etc/apt/sources.list


## dist-upgrade

* dist-upgrade also intelligently handels changing dependencies with new versions of packages.
* It attempt to upgrade the most important pacakges at the expense of less important ones if necessary


## dselect-upgrade

* No mention here


## install

* The /etc/apt/sources.list file is used to locate the desired packages. 
* If a hyphen is appended to the package name (with no intervening space), the identified package will be removed if it is installed.
* A plus sign can be used to designate a package to install


## remove

* Similar with install instead of removing package files
* remove is not to delete configuration files in system


## Source-list file

* When ‘update’ command is run, ‘apt’ program fetches the new packages file by reading ‘source-list’ file. The file consists of deb http uri with parameters
* The format of line is <Archive Type> <Repository URL> <Distribution> <Component>

* Archive Type
    * deb
        * The pre-compiled packages (binary)
    * deb-src
        * Original program sources and Debian control file

* Repository URL
    * Indicates the url to download packages from

* Distribution
    * Is release code name/alias (jessie, stretch, buster, etc.) or the release class (oldstable, stable, testing, unstable)

* Component
    * **main** consists of “DFSG(Debian Free Software Guidelines)-compliant” packages
        * Don’t rely on software outside this area to operate
        * So, only packages considered part of the Debian distribution
    * **contrib** consists of “DFSG-compliant” but, have dependencies not in main
    * **non-free** consists of software that doesn’t comply with the DFSG
