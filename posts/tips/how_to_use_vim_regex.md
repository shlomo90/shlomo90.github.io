# vim regex

---

## Purpose

* Summarize something to make smart coding with vim regex
* Little bit study about regex

### Non greedy match

* Purpose
    * I want to capture the first parameter in strings.
* Strings
    * `test(sssssssss, sssssssss, ssssssssss)`
* Regex
    * `test(\(.\{-}\),`
* Explanation
    * `:help non-greedy`

       non-greedy

       If a "-" appears immediately after the "{", then a shortest match
       first algorithm is used (see example below).  In particular, "\{-}" is
       the same as "*" but uses the shortest match first algorithm.  BUT: A
       match that starts earlier is preferred over a shorter match: "a\{-}b"
       matches "aaab" in "xaaab".

       \{}	Matches 0 or more of the preceding atom, as many as possible (like *)
       \{-}	matches 0 or more of the preceding atom, as few as possible

       Example                 matches
       ab\{2,3}c               "abbc" or "abbbc"
       a\{5}                   "aaaaa"
       ab\{2,}c                "abbc", "abbbc", "abbbbc", etc.
       ab\{,3}c                "ac", "abc", "abbc" or "abbbc"
       a[bc]\{3}d              "abbbd", "abbcd", "acbcd", "acccd", etc.
       a\(bc\)\{1,2}d          "abcd" or "abcbcd"
       a[bc]\{-}[cd]           "abc" in "abcd"
       a[bc]*[cd]              "abcd" in "abcd"

       The } may optionally be preceded with a backslash: \{n,m\}.

### Remove whitespaces at the end of the line

~~~
:%s/\s\+$//gc
~~~

* `\s` stands for "whitespace character".
    * it includes `[ \t\r\n\f]`
* it dedpens on the **regex** flavor.
