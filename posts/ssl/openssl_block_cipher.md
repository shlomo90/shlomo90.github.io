# Block Cipher

---

* is an encryption method that applies a deterministic algorithm along with a **symmetric key** to
  encrypt a block of text, rather than encrypting one bit at a time as in stream ciphers
* Example, `AES128` means encrypting 128 bit blocks with a key of predetermined length: 128, 192, 256 bits
* Modes
    * CBC (cipher block chaining)
    * CFB (cipher feedback)
    * CTR (counter)
    * GCM (Galois/Counter)
