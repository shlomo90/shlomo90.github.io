# header dependency issues

---

* how to solve the dependency issues?
    1. use forwward declare
    2. self-sufficient
        * the header file should have all of the declarations or include in the target c or cpp file
        * Don't depend on other include file or declaration. it may cause a compile error when you user the header file.
    3. Separate code and declaration
        * header files should only have declarations not code.
        * code should be in the corresponding implementation file.
