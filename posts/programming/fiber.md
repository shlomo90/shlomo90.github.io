# Fiber (computer science)

---

* a particularly lightweight thread of execution.
* fibers use cooperative multitasking while threads use preemptive multitasking.
* Threads often depend on the kernel's thread scheduler to preempt a busy thread and resume another thread
* fibers yied themselves to run another fiber while executing.

# Fiber and corutines

* coroutines are a language-level construct.
* fibers are systems-level construct, viewed as threads that happen to not run concurrently

```
Fibers yield control to the single-threaded main program, and when the I/O operation (not needed CPU processing)
is completed fibers continue where they left off.
```

* `setjmp/longjmp` mechanism only supports jumps up the call stack. You cannot do side-jumps or down-jumps.
  Only up-jumps are supported.
