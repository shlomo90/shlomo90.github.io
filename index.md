# JH's Page

---

Hello visitors? This is my first CS technical blog. This blog may have some network things and
code analysis of Nginx, OPENSSL etc.


This blog has also a special purpose that is quick searching what I've done before and refreshing.
It's kind of my small library. Plus, I am trying to write posts in English because many people can access it.
(Sadly, I am not good at English though)


Anyway, Welcome Everyone!
