# Documentation of what you are working

Always I was curious how to write a documentation of your project. Yeah I want to learn the technical writing.
And I found a good example website which are "agilemodeling.com" and "agiledata.org".
It has a lot of things to know for programmers.
I want to share the website. All the things are written in English, Maybe It would take times to read the paper
and understanding what they are. Hopely I believe it's a great step to be a good programmer.

## Best Practices for Simplification of Documentation

* Keep Documentation Just Simple Enough, but not Too Simple
  * Comprehensive documentation does not ensure project success
  * overviews/roadmaps are generally preferred over detailed documentation
    * use Drawing Tools!
    * A simple model that shows the key features
    * Yes, you could model all the scaffolding code that you will need to write, all the getter and setter
      operations that your coding standards tell you to use, but what value would that add? very little.
  * Make it Shorter document 
    * Don't create a five-page document when five bullet points will do
    * Don't create an elaborate and intricately detailed diagram when a sketch will do
    * Don't repeat information found elsewhere when a reference will do
* Write the Fewest Documents with Least Overlap
  * Agile teams often use Wikis. One page described the user interface architecture for our system.

## Vertical Slicing

* What is this?
  * tested piece of functionality that provides some form of business value to an end user.
  * It should be possible to easily deploy a vertical slifce into production upon request.
  * For an agile team all of this implementation work should be accomplished during a single iteration/sprint.
    (typically a one or two-week period).
  * It's agile technique for breaking up a large piece of functionality into something that is easier, safer,
    and quicker to work with

* Why?
  * Reduce the feedback cycle. By focusing on delivering small
  * Lower implementation risk. Working in small vertical slices forces the team into full integrate.
  * Reduce cost of delay.
