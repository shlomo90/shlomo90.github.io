# Netowrk Traffic QoS (Quality of Service)

## QoS Types

1. Traffic Policing
2. Traffic Shaping


## Traffic Policing

* Excess traffic generally dropped
* It appears as a saw-tooth with crests and troughs.
* it's recommended for Voice, Video and Rich media traffic where generally UDP based


## Traffic Shaping

* The traffic reaches a custom configurable bandwidth threshold, additional packets are queued
* it's recommended for TCP based applications
